From several sources on the web I came to the following procedure to make an "empty" ASP.NET into something that will work as I want it to work:

- Create new Project (ASP.NET Core leer)
- Add folder wwwroot to project
- Add folder css to wwwroot
- Create css
- Add folder pages to project
- Add folder Shared to Pages
- Add new razor-layout document (_Layout.cshtml) to shared
- Add stylesheet path to _Layout (<link rel="stylesheet" href="~/css/style.css" />) 
// ~ is wwwroot by default
// to change the root, go to CreateHostBuilder in Program.cs and add .UseWebRoot("sth"); to webBuilder.UseStartup<Startup>();

- Put the desired html-structure in the Layout. 
- Add @RenderBody() where the individual page content shall be put in
- Add new Razor Import to pages (_ViewImports.cshtml)
//- Add line @addTagHelper *, Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc.TagHelpers
- Add the _ViewStart.cshtml page with the following content:
@{
    Layout = "_Layout";
}
(can be found by searching razor)
- In startup, change endpoints from
endpoints.MapGet("/", async context =>
                {
                    await context.Response.WriteAsync("Hello World!");
                });
to
endpoints.MapRazorPages();

- Also add  app.UseStaticFiles(); in method Configure
- Add services.AddRazorPages(); to the method 
  public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
- Add Index.cshtml to Pages folder and put the specific web content that’s not yet in your layout (after the initial lines with @ , not inside the {}!)
