This project is an update of an already existing MasterMind that was done with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery.

The original was not well structured nor commented. In this version I try to improve structure and readability while also getting better used to ASP.NET

Code improvement is not the main focus of this project. Most things will only be copied in.
